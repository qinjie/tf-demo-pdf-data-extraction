<div><table><tr><td>Overview available risk tolerance levels in USD, Longest period of a historical drawdown: The longest period of a historical drawdown of the model investment strategy is an indication of the minimum time required to weather the short-term losses and fluctuations of the portfolio based on historical data.</td><td>31.12.2021 (previous values, 31.12.2020) Risk information: The statements and figures shown above are for illustrative purposes only and intended to help UBS identify a potential investment strategy suitable for the client's investment objectives and risk tolerance. Figures shown are gross values excluding fees and taxes (e.g. transaction fees, mandate fees, surcharges). Depending on the market situation and the investment selection, the actual</td><td>volatility/return of a portfolio may exceed or fall below the expected volatility/return. UBS recommends selecting a risk tolerance that is in line with the client's financial situation and his ability to bear risks. This overview does not create any rights or obligations. UBS does not guarantee that the client's investment objectives and expectations will be achieved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Asset allocation General information: Positions in your portfolio will, if possible, be unbundled, unless unbundling is not possible owing to insufficient information or for product-specific reasons. Please note that the asset structure shown is only indicative and that rounding differences may occur.</td><td>Asset allocation: Asset classes are categorized as follows: Liquidity: Asset class containing investment instruments with main exposure in the money market investments and FX markets. This asset</td><td>class includes cash or term deposits, money market investments and currency certificates/derivatives.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Performance Performance: Conversion of the portfolio value into percentages, calculated as a "Total Return" In addition to price gains/losses, interest earnings (including accured interest) and dividend payments are also included in the calculation. Deposits and payments are assessed using either the "MWR" or the II TWR" method.</td><td>Net performance: Performance after deduction of taxes as well as transaction and portfolio fees. Time weighted rate of return (TWR): The performance is calculated by linking the performances which have occurred between the inflows or outflows, thereby neutralizing the influence of inflows and outflows on performance.</td><td>Retroactive bookings: Retroactive bookings can result in statement calculations deviating from earlier versions. The statement of assets lists the information available on the date on which the statement of assets was created for the relevant valuation date.</td></tr>

<h2>Disclaimer </h2>

<p>This statement of assets only displays the portfolio (assets and liabilities) defined under the heading "Important information - Portfolio definition" </p>

<p>The valuations of individual assets are based on rates and prices derived from available sources of information which are regularly used by banks and which UBS may obtain from third parties. The information is indicative only and no representation or warranty is provided in relation to such information. UBS is not required to buy or sell investments at the displayed rates and prices. Unless a specific date is indicated for a market price, all are listed as of the date the statement of assets was created. A missing or outdated market price may indicate reduced liquidity of the instrument. </p>

<p>In certain cases the market price as at the date when the security was received will be used as the cost price. Deviations from the actual cost price are therefore possible. Cost prices adjusted manually on the basis of client instructions are designated accordingly. The calculated cost prices are not to be used for tax purposes. The prices indicated within the statement of assets as well as other quotations are not to be used as tax values. Calculations are for information purposes only and are not binding for UBS as Corporate Actions or cancelations/rebookings impact costs/prices. </p>

<p>Interest rates on credit and debit balances (including those for call deposits) can change at short notice. Accrued interests on accounts are not always shown. Please check all your interest calculation for the rates actually applied. </p>

<p>LIBOR related positions ("LrP") are identified based on information derived from third parties, such as issuers and data aggregators. This information may be incomplete. As a result, the statement of assets may not reflect all LrP. UBS offers no warranty and accepts no liability that the information derived from third parties is correct, complete and up-to-date, although such information were obtained from sources UBS believes to be reliable. </p>

<p>The country of custody (custodian/depository bank) listed for the deposited securities is not necessarily the same as the location where the deposited securities are actually held. </p>
