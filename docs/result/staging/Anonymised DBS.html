<h1>Your Investment Objectives Setting, Portfolio ESG Rating, Portfolio Risk Rating and Leverage Factor </h1>

<h2>Investment Objectives Setting </h2>

<div><table><tr><td>Investment Objectives</td><td>You want to maximize the growth of your capital and seek high investment returns by focusing your investments on high-risk-rated products or complex products, which may involve high risk of loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Investment Horizon</td><td>Long Term (Between 7 and 10 years)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Investment Profile</td><td>Aggressive Your focus is on maximizing investment returns and you are willing to take on high levels of investment risk to do so. You are comfortable investing in complex products, some of which may be classified as being of the highest risk, and understand that whilst these may generate higher returns there may be a higher risk of significant or total capital loss, volatile returns and low liquidity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Date Signed</td><td>04-JAN-2022</td></tr>

Portfolio ESG Rating
<table><tr><td>Portfolio ESG Rating^</td><td>Average (A)</td></tr>
<tr><td>% of the portfolio AUM that is ESG rated</td><td>79.19%</td></tr>
<caption>Portfolio ESG Rating
</caption></table>
^Portfolio ESG Rating is calculated by taking the weighted average ESG rating of the ESG-rated products in a
portfolio. ESG Rating only applies to stocks, bonds, mutual funds and specific DBS' products.
A coverage ratio is also calculated to indicate the % of the total AUM of all applicable products in a portfolio that
is ESG-rated. For more information regarding MSCI ESG Ratings please refer to

<h2>Important Notice for Accredited Investors </h2>

<p>Where we deal with you as an Accredited Investor (AI), please note the regulatory requirements that we are exempted from when dealing with you as an Al, available at go.dbs.com/sg-accreditedinvestor. You may at any time withdraw your consent to be treated as an accredited investor by submitting a request to opt-out of accredited investor status or by informing your relationship manager. If you opt out of your accredited investor status, this will apply to all DBS account(s) which are held in your name and there may be limitations on the new investment products and/or existing services that we may offer to you. We will however continue to provide services to you for your existing investments. </p>

<h2>Transition of Interest Rate Benchmarks </h2>

<p>Inter-bank Offered Rates ("IBOR"), including the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and the Singapore Inter-bank Offered Rate ("SIBOR") will be discontinued progressively from 31 December 2021. The Singapore Dollar Swap Offer Rate ("SOR") which is computed based on LIBOR will be similarly impacted. DBS is working closely with local authorities and industry participants to enable a seamless transition for its clients. Clients who have credit facilities with us or who hold investment products that may be impacted will be contacted. To understand more about the IBOR Transition and the transition timeline, please visit www.dbs.com/about-us/ibor.page </p>

<h2>Shorter Securities Settlement Cycle on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) </h2>

<p>Effective 10 Dec 2018, the settlement cycle for securities is two days (Trade date plus two days) to align with the new SGX securities settlement cycle. Please ensure that you have sufficient cash and securities balance in your CPFIS / SRS account, and investible stock limit in your CPFIS and/or Ordinary Account before requesting for any securities transaction with us. Your trade will be accepted up to your available investible stock limit, funds or securities upon receipt by the bank. </p>

<h2>DBS Private Banking Investment Suitability Framework </h2>

<p>Under our investment suitability framework, your overall Portfolio Risk Rating will be compared against your investment profile based on your responses in the Investment Objectives Setting Questionnaire. Your overall Portfolio Risk Rating is calculated based on the risk rating of each product, its investment amount and its allocation of your overall portfolio taken on a volatilities weighted average basis. Individually, there could be some products in your portfolio with risk ratings which may exceed the threshold for your investment profile. However, your overall Portfolio Risk Rating should not exceed your investment profile. Higher investment amount and allocation of your portfolio to products with higher risk ratings will increase your Portfolio Risk Rating, and may result in your investment risk exceeding your investment profile. Likewise, lower investment amount and allocation of your portfolio to products with higher risk ratings will reduce your Portfolio Risk Rating. </p>

<h2>Additional Disclosure for accounts booked in Hong Kong or managed by a Relationship Manager in Hong Kong </h2>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the assessment of investment risk on a portfolio basis as described herein does not involve the bank adopting a portfolio-based approach in assessing suitability for private banking customers as set out by the relevant laws and regulations in Hong Kong. The assessment of investment risk on a portfolio basis refers solely to the bank calculating your exposure to products with different risk ratings taking into account the investment amount and individual product risk ratings. This is to allow you to invest in a mix of lower and higher risk rated products whilst maintaining a Portfolio Risk Rating which is appropriate given your Investment Profile. This is distinct from the adoption of a portfolio-based approach to assessing suitability, which may take place only where, among other things, there is an investment mandate for a portfolio agreed at the outset between you and the bank. </p>

<h2>Important information on Leverage </h2>

<p>Leverage amplifies the risks in your portfolio in terms of both potential gains as well as potential losses would increase in proportion to the degree of leverage employed. By taking on leverage, you accept that you may lose a significant part, or all, of your capital, and are prepared to make good any losses over and above the principal you invest in certain cases. </p>

<p> Leverage Factor is calculated based on the following: Gross Assets/Net Assets </p>

<p>Gross Assets comprise cash, investments, notional amount of outstanding derivative transactions (without consideration of netting effect of any offsetting foreign exchange transactions) and mark-to-market gains or </p>

<p>losses from outstanding derivative transactions. </p>

<p>Net Assets comprise cash, investments, mark-to-market gains or losses from outstanding derivative transactions minus loans. </p>

<p>Real property, universal life insurance policies and loans secured by such assets are excluded from the computation of Gross Assets and Net Assets. </p>

<p>Where loans are secured by assets held in a separate account or portfolio, the Leverage Factor may not take into account the full value of such other assets. </p>

<p>Leverage Factor accounts for both implicit leverage (e.g. derivatives on margins) and explicit leverage (e.g. loans). The Leverage Factor threshold should not be construed as a recommendation as to leverage levels. It serves as a reminder to clients not to take excessive leverage beyond the specified threshold applicable to their investment profiles. As leverage may result in the leveraged return volatilities increasing beyond the underlying asset volatilities (unleveraged return volatilities), clients should assess and understand the risks of leverage before incorporating any form of leverage in their portfolios. </p>

<p>The Portfolio Risk Rating and Leverage Factor is in respect to your portfolio. If you maintain any other account(s) or portfolio(s) with the Bank, the Portfolio Risk Rating and Leverage Factor for each such account or portfolio will be calculated separately. </p>
